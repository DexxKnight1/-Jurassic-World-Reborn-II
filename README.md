## About the pack:

If you’re a fan of dinosaurs, then this is definitely something you should be checking out. There is plenty to do, which makes this a fun and enjoyable experience in open world adventure with Prehistoric flora & fauna. A lot of dungeons, structures, temples and dimensions waiting to be explored.

So, the way that things get done around here is that you have a lot of opportunities to experiment with a broad selection of offerings to figure out exactly what you want. There are plenty of different options and choices to take a look at, so it’s easy to find the best results. You would be wise to experiment with all the different resources that are on offer, because there’s a lot of things that you can do with this.

At the end of the day, you could also start working with modded Minecraft server hosting in order to play with your friends and have a unique experience that has many depths to it. Try to build your own Jurassic world because there has definitely something survived!

To run this pack I'll recommend to allocate about to **12GB** amount of **RAM**.

These **JVM** arguments will optimize things and hopefully sort out a lot of lag.
